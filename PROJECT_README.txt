Running on Windows XP :

Installed Yeoman http://yeoman.io/

then did the following : 

npm install -g generator-angular  # install generator
yo angular                        # scaffold out a AngularJS project
bower install angular-ui          # install a dependency for your project from Bower
grunt test                        # test your app
grunt server                      # preview your app
grunt                             # build the application for deployment

Warning on Windows XP 

bower 

only worked through Git Bash, so therefore you may as well be in git bash all the time
